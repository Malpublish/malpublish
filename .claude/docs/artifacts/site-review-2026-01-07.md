## Overview

**Overall:** Clean, professional landing page. Good foundation, but several opportunities to strengthen impact.

---

## What's Working Well

- Clear definition hierarchy (term → pronunciation → meaning)
- Strong visual structure with alternating section backgrounds
- Good SEO setup (meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter cards)
- CTA prominently links to publishingpolicy.org
- Mobile-responsive layout

---

## Improvement Opportunities

### High Impact

| Issue | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **No OG image** | Social shares show no preview image - major missed opportunity for virality |
| **No favicon** | Looks unfinished in browser tabs |
| **CTA link unverified** | Links to `/build` route - is PublishingPolicy.org ready for that? |
| **Hero is plain** | First impression could be stronger with subtle visual interest |

### Content/Structure

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Facets inconsistent | #1 has bullet list, others have paragraphs - pick one format |
| "Malpublicist" definition odd | "One who promotes malpublishing" - who would do that? Maybe "One who engages in..." |
| Guidelines overlap facets | 8 guidelines + 4 facets = cognitive overload. Consider consolidating |
| No real examples | Abstract definitions without concrete instances of malpublishing |

### UX

| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| No section navigation | Long scroll with no way to jump - consider sticky nav or anchor links |
| No citation feature | Academics would want to cite this definition |
| Table on mobile | May be cramped - consider card layout for terms |

### Nice-to-have

- Structured data (JSON-LD) for definition schema - helps Google show rich results
- Subtle animation on scroll
- Social share buttons
- Dark mode support

## Recommended Priority

1. **Add OG image** - biggest ROI for sharing
2. **Add favicon** - quick polish
3. **Verify CTA destination** - don't send people to a broken link
4. **Consolidate content** - reduce redundancy between facets and guidelines

- [ ] Decide which improvements to pursue
- [ ] Create initiative if pursuing multiple items
