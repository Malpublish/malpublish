## Core Definition

**Malpublish** (verb): "To publish in a manner that constitutes malpractice." Coined March 2023 by Roarke Clinton, this neologism combines the prefix "mal-" (bad/wrongful) with "publish" to identify unethical publishing practices.

---

## Etymology

The term fills a linguistic gap by naming conduct leading to misinformation that "was previously hard to capture in a single term." Similar constructions include "malpractice" and "malfunction," where "mal-" denotes incorrect or harmful action.

---

## Why It Matters

Malpublishing is identified as "the cause of misinformation." Without unethical publishing practices, misinformation wouldn't proliferate. The term provides language for communities to discuss publishing standards, severity of violations, and appropriate responses.

## Scope Clarification

Writing opinions, theories, or fiction doesn't constitute malpublishing if practices remain ethical. Content must be "clearly labeled" appropriately, and audiences shouldn't be "deceived about the content's intent or factual accuracy."

---

## Practical Guidelines to Avoid Malpublishing

1. **Fact-Check Information**: Verify accuracy through credible sources and cross-reference facts
2. **Distinguish Facts from Opinions**: Clearly label editorial content separate from factual reporting
3. **Provide Proper Attribution**: Cite sources according to established style guides (APA, MLA, AP)
4. **Engage in Responsible Editing**: Follow ethical guidelines respecting content integrity
5. **Offer Transparent Corrections**: Publicly correct misinformation promptly
6. **Respect Intellectual Property**: Ensure publishing rights and respect copyright laws
7. **Use Plagiarism Detection**: Employ tools to identify unintentional plagiarism
8. **Make Corrections Immediately**: Address any content contravening ethical standards without delay

---

## Reader Responsibility

Consumers should approach content critically, question sources, and call out apparent malpublishing. This accountability creates "a culture of responsible publishing" and demands better standards from publishers and platforms.

---

## Future Implications

The framework may inspire development of certification systems proving ethical practices, more rigorous editorial training, and technologies preventing malpublishing. Widespread adoption could "restore trust in the publishing industry" and promote informed decision-making.

---

## Publisher Statement

Roarke Clinton emphasizes that malpublish remains factual regardless of adoption rates, as it "accurately describes a real problem" in contemporary publishing. A comprehensive white paper and book titled "Malpublishers" were planned for 2024 publication.
